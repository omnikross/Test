= Abstraction

== Answers

1. ==Stacks and queues are abstractions in that they describe how a collection of data should behave without prescribing
    low-level implementation details. In particular, a stack is characterized by its support for operations like push and pop,
    which behave in a last-in-first-out fashion, while a queue is characterized by its support for operations like enqueue and dequeue,
    which behave in a first-in-first-out fashion.

3. ==Strings are objects that represent sequences of characters.
    The standard string class provides support for such objects with an interface similar to that of a standard container of bytes, 
    but adding features specifically designed to operate with strings of single-byte characters.

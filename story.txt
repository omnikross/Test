1. If they used an array they must know the length of the array(number of users).Not so mutch yser can read Medium same time or they all can do it 
    at similar time.In first-medium waste of memory; In second- they have to reallocate the array dynamically.

2. Because with linked list Medium just waste a lot of time for a linear search to check wheher a user has already read some post.

3. If they use a trie they will have quite a few NULL pointers  and in this case space-saving common prefixes would be rare.

4. Because Medium use Bloom filter, which have risk false positives(not negative). Bloom filtee-array of bits each initialized to 0,
    some of which are then set to 1 with multiple hash functions.When a user reads post, Medium hashes that postâ€™s ID with multiple hash functions. 
    When someone reads smth output of those hash functions as indices into the array and give them index 1.But some  IDs might collectively hash to those same indices
    and give to us fasle.

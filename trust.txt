= Trusting `clang`

== Answers

1. We can change 
if(c == 'n')
        return('\n');
    and get this
if(c == 'n' || c == 'N')
        return('\n');
        
2. A Trojan horse could already be compiled into your installation of clang, the code for which has 
been removed from clang's open source. And even if the source code for clang not contain "horse",
the compiler which compile your clang could already be compromised, in which case it could 
admit a Trojan horse into your own compilation.

1. Get_char must return char value, like CHAR_MAX-const.

2.  The second char  will be assigned a value if the user has inputted two or more characters, 
    in which case sscanf will return 2 for which our condition can check.

3. If they not declared as static, any program that links against the library can change their values and break it.

4. When  we use Get_String which allocates memory for a string adds that memoryâ€™s address to a array 
    before returning adress.Then, after main-exit(teardown) iterates aver array and frees memory.
